# Text-to-Image-using-Stack-GANs
The training of StackGAN has been performed on CUB dataset. CUB contains 200 bird species with 11,788 images.
Since 80% of birds in this dataset have object-image size ratios of less than 0.5, as a pre-processing step,
cropping has been executed for all images to ensure that bounding boxes of birds have greater-than-0.75 object-image size ratios.
The dataset can either be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hbzc_P1FuxMkcabkgn9ZKinBwW683j45/view?usp=sharing 
and the embeddings from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3y_msrWZaXLT1BZdVdycDY5TEE/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-sZrhftoEfdvHq6MweAeCjA
download them and place them in the required folder
